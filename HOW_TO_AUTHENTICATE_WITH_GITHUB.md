# How to Authenticate and Push to GitHub

You've encountered an authentication error because this terminal can't ask for your password directly. The secure solution is to use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

Follow these steps exactly.

### Step 1: Generate Your Personal Access Token on GitHub

1.  **Open GitHub in a new browser tab.**
2.  Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner, then go to **Settings**.
3.  On the left-hand menu, scroll down and click on **Developer settings**.
4.  Click on **Personal access tokens**, then select **Tokens (classic)**.
5.  Click **Generate new token** and select **Generate new token (classic)**.
6.  **Note**: Give your token a name, like `firebase-studio-access`.
7.  **Expiration**: Set an expiration date. 30 days is a good default.
8.  **Select scopes**: This is the most important step. Check the box next to **`repo`**. This grants the token permission to access and push to your repositories.
9.  Scroll to the bottom and click **Generate token**.
10. **COPY YOUR TOKEN!** This is your only chance to see it. Copy the token string (it will start with `ghp_...`) and paste it somewhere safe temporarily, like a text editor.

### Step 2: Use Your Token in the Terminal

Now, come back to this Firebase Studio terminal and run the following two commands.

**1. Re-add your remote URL (this clears the old one):**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Bisheshguragain/TimeTickr.git
```
*(If you get an error that 'origin' already exists, run `git remote remove origin` first, then run the command above again).*

**2. Push your code using the token:**

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with the token you just copied (the one starting with `ghp_...`).

```bash
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN_HERE@github.com/Bisheshguragain/TimeTickr.git
```

And that's it! Your code will be pushed securely to your repository.
